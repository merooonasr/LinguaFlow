        <p class="glass-box">
            Hi, this is AJ Hoge, Director of the Effortless English Club. Welcome to our new set of
            lessons, these are called the Power English Lessons. The reason they‚Äôre called Power
            English is because in these lessons we‚Äôre going to do two things. Number one, you‚Äôre
            going to learn English, of course. As always, we have the mini‚Äêstories which are our
            favorite lessons for most of our members, but the content, the focus, the topics in these
            lessons are going to be focused on the psychology of learning and the psychology of
            success.
        </p>
        <p class="glass-box">
            Now these ideas, they‚Äôre not just my ideas. In fact, they come from a lot of other
            people. They come from people like Tony Robbins, who is a famous success coach,
            Robert Anton Wilson, Joe Vitale, Robert Kiyosaki, Alan Watt, so I‚Äôve taken a lot of ideas
            from a lot of different people about this topic of the psychology of success. And the
            reason that we‚Äôre going to talk about this in these lessons is that in my experience, most
            English students struggle and fail because of psychology, not because of methods, not
            because of teachers.
        </p>
        <p class="glass-box">
            Those things are important, but Tony Robbins talks about the fact that psychology is
            80% of success. And I think he‚Äôs right, based on my experience with many, many
            English students. Psychology is 80% of success, so 20% are the methods you use to
            study. 20% are the schools you go to, the teachers you have, the books you use.
            Those are important, we talk a lot about them. But the other 80% is psychology, your
            motivation, your emotions, how you manage your time. All of these things are in fact
            much, much more important.
        </p>
        <p class="glass-box">
            What I saw in my classes were that the enthusiastic students, the energetic students,
            the optimistic students always learned much faster. They succeeded. The ones who
            failed, the ones who dropped out and quit, the ones who struggled had the opposite
            mentality. They had a very negative mentality. Their motivation was low. They tended
            to be pessimistic. They felt that they weren‚Äôt good at English. They had ideas that
            English was very tough, very difficult, they struggled. They didn‚Äôt have enthusiasm for
            English. They didn‚Äôt love English.
        </p>
        <p class="glass-box">
            So in these lessons we‚Äôre going to talk about how can you manage your emotions. How
            can you develop that strong, powerful, enthusiastic attitude towards English, how can
            you maintain it so that you don‚Äôt get bored? So that in fact you get stronger and
            stronger with English and your psychology gets stronger and you succeed, you reach
            your goals. You speak fluently, effortlessly. So among teachers, English teachers,
            language teachers, this topic is called Non-Linguistic Factors. Non‚ÄêLinguistic Factors.
        </p>
        <p class="glass-box">
            So what ‚ÄúNon‚ÄêLinguistic Factors‚Äù means is things that are not related to language
            learning directly. When we talk about language learning research, when we talk about
            the best methods to use when you learn English, those are linguistic factors, right?
            They are related to the language. Non‚Äêlinguistic factors means not related to the
            language. This has nothing to do with English, it‚Äôs more about psychology. Motivation,
            for example, is a non‚Äêlinguistic factor. So all it really means is just emotional factors.
            And there are actually many research studies about this topic.
        </p>
        <p class="glass-box">
            Dr. Stephen Krashen down in Los Angeles, probably again the expert in language
            acquisition and language learning, has done many studies and he has also looked at
            many studies and he‚Äôs found that non‚Äêlinguistic factors are equally or in fact more
            important than the linguistic factors to determine who is successful ultimately. What that
            means is that things like your emotions, things like your peer group, the community that
            you belong to, your feelings about English are as important or more important than the
            methods you‚Äôre using to learn English.
        </p>
        <p class="glass-box">
            So how are we going to do this? How are we going to learn? Well, one of the things we
            have to do is create a daily English ritual. You need to engage your physiology. That
            means you need to engage and use your body. You need to engage and use your
            subconscious. That‚Äôs how you start to affect and strengthen your psychology. So we
            have to strengthen our psychology, what does that mean? Really it means affecting
            your body and your mind at the same time, so that you actually feel better. Your
            emotions are happier while you‚Äôre learning English. And I know this is the opposite of
            what you learned in school.
        </p>
        <p class="glass-box">
            You probably didn‚Äôt feel very happy when you were sitting in your English classes. But
            when you‚Äôre learning with Effortless English, it‚Äôs very important for you to feel happy.
            For your body to feel good, for your mind to feel good. For you to emotionally enjoy the
            process of learning English. Of course, it‚Äôs just more fun, you‚Äôre going to like it a lot
            better. But the other benefit is that you actually will learn faster. You‚Äôll improve your
            grammar faster, you‚Äôll improve your pronunciation faster. You‚Äôll remember vocabulary
            words better, longer and faster when you feel good. So there‚Äôs a very practical reason
            for doing this, too.
        </p>
        <p class="glass-box">
            So we‚Äôre going to talk a lot in detail in these lessons about how to do this. But just right
            now, during this introduction, let‚Äôs talk a little bit about a daily plan. Something you
            could do immediately, right now, today, to start improving your success with English by
            changing your psychology. So here‚Äôs a little ritual, a little plan you can follow every day
            to start improving, to start feeling better and therefore improve your motivation and to
            learn English faster and faster and faster, better and better and better. And it‚Äôs very
            simple.
        </p>
        <p class="glass-box">
            So the first thing you‚Äôre going to do is when you get up in the morning, the first part of
            this plan, this daily plan. You want to get into a peak emotional state. Peak means top.
            For example, the top of a mountain, when we talk about a top of a mountain, the very
            top we call the peak. So we‚Äôre saying a peak emotional state means a top emotional
            state or top emotional feeling. It means you want to feel great. Not just good, you want
            to feel really great. That‚Äôs the first thing you need to do before you listen to any English
            lessons. Before you study you want to first be sure that you feel great.
        </p>
        <p class="glass-box">
            How can you do it? Well, it‚Äôs really easy. I recommend, for example, using music. And
            I actually do this myself in the morning, most mornings. I will put on some great,
            exciting music that I love, jump around, act like a crazy person, and get myself feeling
            energetic and happy. Do that first before you listen. So move your body, smile. We‚Äôre
            going to talk about this more in detail in later lessons. But just for now, every morning
            when you get up first put on some music. Some energetic, happy music that you like,
            smile, move around. Do that for maybe 5 minutes, maybe 10 minutes. Then when
            you‚Äôre feeling really great, your body is moving, you feel like you have energy, you‚Äôre
            happy, then start your English lessons.
        </p>
        <p class="glass-box">
            The first thing you want to listen to is the main article, the main audio. So the first thing
            is listen to the main talk. And you can read this as well the first time if you cannot
            understand easily, you can read the transcript and listen at the same time. Do this
            perhaps two times per day, starting with the main story and reading. Use a dictionary if
            you need to to look up new words.
        </p>
        <p class="glass-box">
            Next, listen to the vocabulary. So in the vocabulary again I will discuss the meanings of
            some of the difficult words that I used. And again, you can read the transcript of that
            vocabulary lesson. There‚Äôs always a transcript you can read if you can‚Äôt understand my
            speaking, if I‚Äôm too fast, then read at the same time. It‚Äôs okay.
        </p>
        <p class="glass-box">
            Next, you‚Äôll listen to the mini‚Äêstory and the mini‚Äêstory is the most important lesson. The
            mini‚Äêstory is designed for deep learning. In the mini‚Äêstory I am going to ask a lot of very
            easy questions while I tell a story. In fact I really ask the story, I don‚Äôt tell the story. Why
            am I doing this? Students ask me ‚ÄúWhy are the questions so easy?‚Äù Well, the
            questions are supposed to be easy because I want you to answer fast and
            automatically. I want you to train your brain, teach your brain to answer very quickly.
            I don‚Äôt want you to translate from your language to English or from English to your
            language. It‚Äôs a bad habit, it will make you speak very slowly. I want you to just answer
            quickly, automatically, very fast. So that‚Äôs why I ask so many questions, like questions
            again, again, again, again, again...very easy. Your job...answer the questions quickly.
            You can answer with only one or two words, its okay. Short answers are fine. You don‚Äôt
            need to answer with a big, long sentence. In fact, short is better.
        </p>
        <p class="glass-box">
            So that‚Äôs the order that you‚Äôre going to follow. You‚Äôre going to listen to the main article
            first, one or two times. You can read as well if you need to. Then you‚Äôre going to listen
            to the vocabulary one or two times, each day. And then finally you‚Äôre going to listen to
            the mini‚Äêstory, one or two times or more. You can also read the transcript for the
            mini‚Äêstory in the beginning.
        </p>
        <p class="glass-box">
            Now another important point, when you‚Äôre listening to these lessons do not study them.
            Don‚Äôt struggle to memorize. Just relax and listen. If necessary, you can read as well,
            as I said if you need to. But relax, you‚Äôre not trying to memorize anything. Just let it
            come in. Let the English come into your ears and into your eyes. Don‚Äôt think about it.
            Don‚Äôt analyze it. Do not think about grammar. The mini‚Äêstories will help you learn
            grammar subconsciously, so don‚Äôt interrupt that process by trying to analyze it. Don‚Äôt
            think about grammar rules.
        </p>
        <p class="glass-box">
            You want to learn like a native speaker and that means you‚Äôre going to learn the
            patterns of English in these mini‚Äêstories. You might not be able to explain them, just like
            native speakers cannot explain grammar rules. But that‚Äôs okay, you want to be able to
            use them correctly. That‚Äôs the important part. So again, you want to relax. Do not
            study. Do not think about grammar rules. Do not try to translate. Just relax and listen.
            That‚Äôs why we call it Effortless English. It should be effortless. You should be smiling,
            relaxed and just listening.
        </p>
        <p class="glass-box">
            Now another important point. You want to move your body while you‚Äôre listening to the
            lessons. This will keep your energy high. So, what do I mean by that? Well, a really
            easy way to do this is just to walk. You‚Äôve got an iPod, you‚Äôve got your earphones in,
            listen to the lessons while you go for a walk. You can do two things at one time. You
            exercise, you improve your body and you listen to English lessons and improve your
            mind at the same time.
        </p>
        <p class="glass-box">
            If you‚Äôre sitting in a train, then maybe you just stretch your body a little bit. If you‚Äôre in
            your car, you can move a little bit. You can move around in your seat. If you‚Äôre at your
            house you can go crazy, you can jump around. You can exercise very strongly. You
            can go to the gym. Do something with your body while you‚Äôre listening to the lessons.
            It will keep your energy high. It will keep you feeling better. You will actually learn faster
            by doing that.
        </p>
        <p class="glass-box">
            And finally, a very, very important point. You need to use our deep learning method.
            That means you listen to each lesson set for one week or more. So for example, this
            introduction has got three parts. There is a main lecture, a main talk. There is a
            vocabulary section. And there is a mini‚Äêstory. Well those three, you want to listen to
            those three every day for seven days. You want that repetition.
        </p>
        <p class="glass-box">
            Repetition is very important. You want it to go deeply into your brain. Just one time is
            not enough. Even if it is very easy for you, if you listen you understand everything, it‚Äôs
            simple, still follow the deep learning method. Still listen to the whole set for one week or
            more. On the other hand, if it seems very difficult, listen longer. Two weeks is okay.
            Doesn‚Äôt matter, the point is you want it to go very deeply into your brain which means
            you want it to be almost effortless. It‚Äôs going to just go into your brain and eventually
            just come out without you thinking and that requires deep learning. It requires a lot of
            repetition.
        </p>
        <p class="glass-box">
            So that‚Äôs kind of your basic plan for using these lessons. Again, first you‚Äôre going to get
            into a peak state. You‚Äôre going to get excited. You‚Äôre going to jump around. You‚Äôre
            going to listen to music. You‚Äôre going to feel great. Then you‚Äôre going to listen to the
            main lecture, the main audio, one or two times. Then you‚Äôre going to listen to the
            vocabulary, one or two times. Then you‚Äôre going to listen to the mini‚Äêstory, one, two,
            three, four, five times...every day. And remember, relax, feel good and enjoy the
            lessons while you listen.
        </p>
        <p class="glass-box">
            Okay, that is it for our main section for this introduction. Next is the vocabulary.
